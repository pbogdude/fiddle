# jsbin or jsfiddle or blockbuilder?

There are quite a few JavaScript playgrounds.  For our purposes, <http://blockbuilder.org> may be the best.

Here's how to load Mike Bostock's block <https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045> in each one.

# blockbuilder.org

Browse to: <https://blockbuilder.org/mbostock/4062045>.  

That's right, all you have to do is change "https://bl.ocks.org" to "http://blockbuilder.org" in the URL.  What's notable is that the HTML file loads data from the gist, and blockbuilder.org continues loading the data from the gist.

# jsbin.com

Here's the gist that underlies the block: <https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4062045>.

Browse to: https://gist.jsbin.com/mbostock/4062045

This is similar to blockbuilder.org in that all you have to do is change "github" to "jsbin" in the gist's URL. But...

1. You'll have to change the URL for the data. In this case, you'll change

        d3.json("miserables.json", function(error, graph) {

to

        var url = "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mbostock/4062045/raw/5916d145c8c048a6e3086915a6be464467391c62/";
        d3.json(url + "miserables.json", function(error, graph) {
  
1. jsbin.com also seems to have a little trouble loading the files. For example, in my experience, the JavaScript window has some stray characters "sadfsdfsafsdsdsadf" that might cause problems.

# fiddle

JSFiddle.com has a nice collaborative mode, but it's the most difficult to configure for loading gists.  The files in this repo have been set up to load automatically in JSFiddle. To simply open this repo in JSFIddle, click:

<http://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/umbcvis/fiddle/tree/master/>

The files used by JSFiddle:

* demo.html (html without boilerplate tags: doctype, html, meta, etc.)
* demo.css (CSS only)
* demo.js (JavaScript only)
* demo.details (manifest for configuring remote resources, such as d3.v4.min.js)
* miserables.json (data served from the master branch)

This demo applies <a href="http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/github_read.html" target="_blank">JSfiddle guidelines</a> to [Mike Bostock's force-directed graph visualization](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4064025).  Several important modifications show up in ```demo.js```:

Here are some other things that were changed to make it work well...

* window.onload -- the callback contains all the code from the block
* svg -- the ```viewBox``` attribute and CSS ```width: 100%``` allow it to fit in the JSFiddle frame
* miserables.json -- served from this github project's website

#### github project site

The same files open with index.html (not used by JSFiddle) at the github project site:

<https://umbcvis.github.io/fiddle/>

See the [Github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/)
for guidance on configuring gh-pages to serve files from the master branch.
